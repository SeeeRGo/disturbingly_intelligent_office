### Render sensor data list
The task is to get sensors data and render a compelling visualization. You have complete creative freedom, but there is time limit of about 2 hours, don't spend over 3 hours in any case.<br>
There is a couple requirements:
  - There is color coding for storage - Green(60-100% of capacity), Yellow(30-60%), Orange(10-30%), Red(0-10%)
  - Have some indication about containers that have to be restocked<br>

If time allows I would like to see some tests written, anything that you'd like. Use any leftover time to make the list even more beautiful. After you've finished submit a PR for review

The project setup is git clone, yarn install, yarn start, nothing fancy yet in this department
